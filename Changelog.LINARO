Changelog for qemu-linaro
=========================

Note that this changelog only covers ARM-related changes
since the previous qemu-linaro release; since we track
upstream fairly closely there will be various upstream
changes which we incorporate but which are not listed
here. For full change detail consult the git history:

Bug numbers refer to Launchpad qemu-linaro bugs, eg:

version 2011.03-0:

 - Introduces a model of the ARM Versatile Express with
   Cortex-A9MPx4 daughterboard ("vexpress-a9")
 - Fixes #644961: linux-user mode now supports epoll syscalls
 - Fixes #721801: linux-user mode llseek on 64 bit hosts no longer
   truncates the returned  seek position to 32 bits
 - Fixes #714600: OMAP3 UARTs now handle the extensions beyond
   16550A compatibility; in particular Linux images using the
   omap-hsuart driver can now boot to a shell prompt
 - Fixes #714606: an SD card model bug was causing spurious
   "not in Sending-Data state" messages on OMAP3
 - Fixes #716336: should now compile on SPARC
 - Fixes #713101: the OMAP3 MMC model no longer causes Linux
   to hang if it tries to enable a swapfile
 - Has a number of minor ARM instruction correctness fixes
 - Partial fix for #728630: linux-user mode now has a dummy
   implementation of prlimit64 to silence the warnings when
   running newer versions of apt, pending a proper implementation
   of this syscall.

version 2011.02-0:

 - There are no changes in this version compared to RC2

version 2011.02-0 RC2:

 - Fixes #709711, #711272: compile failure with Ubuntu ARM compiler
 - Fixes #709965: don't ship binary ROMs without clear license
 - Update to newer version of upstream trunk
 - Remove essentially dead code in qemu-lock.h that could cause
   compile failure on ARM when compiling without optimisation

version 2011.02-0 RC1:

 - This initial qemu-linaro release includes all the ARM code generation
   fixes from the qemu-meego tree; these are mainly Neon related
 - The OMAP3 support from qemu-meego is also included
 - Fixes #703094: newer u-boot MMC drivers would fail with
   "timedout waiting for stat!" message
 - Fixes #622408: silences spurious "SD: Unknown CMD52" messages
 - Fixes #704484: newer x-loader images were causing qemu to die
   immediately with "Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM"
 - Fixes #697684: implements missing syscall 341 and ioctl 0xc020660b;
   these were causing lots of warnings when running newer versions
   of apt-get under qemu usermode emulation
